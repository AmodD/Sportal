So for example , a 'National Football Tournament' would have been conducted every year from say 2011 to 2017. So each year here will be a season. Lets say the '2015 season' would then have many events in various levels or categories like 'under-21' , 'under-14' , 'mens' , 'girls' etc. Each event would then have its own set of teams and matches amongst them in a league or knock out format</p>
